*Plato* is a document reader for *Kobo*'s e-readers.

**This is a fork for the reMarkable (gen 1) device.**

Also see [darvin](https://github.com/darvin)'s
[work](https://github.com/darvin/plato) of 
porting plato to the reMarkable 2 years ago.
(I Read a nice mangas with his port. :))

I wanted to do a new fork of it to maybe enjoy
some new features. I also wanted to do a
integration with mango. Building my own UI
seems to be a bit to much, so I'll try to add it
to plato once I'm finished porting it.

**This repo is wip!** Remarkable-specific setup
instructions, configuration help and releases are still missing.  
If you manage to build it, you'll sit before an blank
home screen.

Documentation: [GUIDE](doc/GUIDE.md), [MANUAL](doc/MANUAL.md) and [BUILD](doc/BUILD.md).
