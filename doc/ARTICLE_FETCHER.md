A *wallabag* article fetcher is distributed in the release archive, in `bin/article_fetcher`.

## Configuration

Rename `Settings-sample.toml` to `Settings.toml` and fill it out.

The fetcher manages a `.session.json` file that you shouldn't modify or remove.

## Usage

In the library menu:
- Select *Library → On Board*.
- Select *Toggle Select → Articles* (the downloaded articles are saved in the hook's *path*).

If the *Toggle Select* sub-menu is missing, [add the relevant hook](HOOKS.md).
