## Install

Pick one of the [one-click install packages](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=314220).

## Configure

The settings are saved in and read from `Settings.toml`. You can edit this file when *Plato* isn't running or is in shared mode. You can enter the shared mode by connecting your device to a computer.

The default ePUB stylesheet, `css/epub.css`, can be overridden via `css/epub-user.css`.

## Upgrade

Install the corresponding one-click package on top of the previous one. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/baskerville/plato/releases) before upgrading: manual intervention might be required.
